                        In a world where the browsing market is dominated by major competitors who treat user information as a mere commodity, four ambitious individuals came together with a common goal - to solve a problem that they all personally faced.

                        Unnati and Prakshal were no strangers to the world of startups, having already founded their first venture called Zeal. However, they quickly realized that finding the right team wasn&apos;t enough to build a successful business. They needed a more sustainable solution, one that could address a problem they both faced firsthand.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div className={styles.img_paragraph}>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: 'large' }}>
                        Prakshal had experienced the issue during his internship at Meta, where he missed crucial information during meetings due to missing links on his device. Unnati, on the other hand, was organizing an event with a friend and sent her the link to submit a proposal. Her friend scolded her for not having an Apple device and having to email herself the link from her phone to access it on her laptop. This inspired them to create a more inclusive solution.

                    </div>
                    <p style={{ fontSize: 'large' }}>
                        Meanwhile, Swastik and Prakshal met at UB Hacking and quickly bonded over their shared experiences. Swastik had been a victim of a banking scam and could empathize with the need for a safer browsing experience. Together, they built the first prototype of Continuity Browser - a solution that would make browsing more seamless and secure for all.

                        As fate would have it, they were also introduced to Dr. Scott, a seasoned researcher who shared their passion for productivity. Dr. Scott had faced the challenge of visiting multiple websites to find simple facts, and was eager to join forces with the team.

                <p style={{ fontSize: 'large' }}>
                    And thus, Continuity was born - a browser that not only addresses the challenges of device compatibility, but also ensures a more streamlined browsing experience for everyone. With their shared experiences and passion for innovation, this dynamic team is committed to revolutionalize the browsing experience and making the internet a better place for all.

                    I love working as a Software Engineer because it gives an artistic point of view and abstracts the complexity hidden underneath as well as provides the fun of working on sophisticated logic to handle data efficiently. I have been working on designing, prototyping, and implementing user interfaces for over 5 years with multiple industry-level work experiences. The UI/UX is so important because it is one of the first things that help customers emotionally connected to a product/company.
