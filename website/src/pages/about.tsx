                    I love working as a Software Engineer because it gives an artistic point of view and abstracts the complexity hidden underneath as well as provides the fun of working on sophisticated logic to handle data efficiently. I have been working on designing, prototyping, and implementing user interfaces for over 5 years with multiple industry-level work experiences. The UI/UX is so important because it is one of the first things that help customers emotionally connected to a product/company.
